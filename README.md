Animal on Wild Rice was created for Kendra Wight, a child librarian, she and her partner had a running joke of making a website devoted to poorly “ms paint” collaged images of animals on wild rice.  It was one of my first projects while in school and I wanted to take the idea a step further.  I wanted to create a social media experience so that others could join in on the joke and an application to create these Paint-style images.
